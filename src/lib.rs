//! Library that drives mgit.
//!
//! Note that this is (the third iteration of) my first real Rust project. In other
//! words: it's not the utter disaster that was the first version, but I still
//! don't know whether I'm using Rust "correctly." If the code looks wonky, it's
//! probably not because it's doing something clever; it's probably because it's
//! wonky. (Please let me know! Working out the wonkiness is an important part of
//! this exercise.)
//!
//! In terms of performance (namely, copying values around) mgit tries to be as
//! reasonable as possible. References are used wherever my not-quite-complete
//! understanding allows for it. But if there's a choice between clean, clear code
//! that copies values and some monstrosity that's nasty but avoids copies, mgit
//! chooses clean+copy. In practice, this usually means copying a small-ish (say, <
//! 100 items) collection of primitive values, so the actual performance hit is
//! negligible.
//!
//! The only place where mgit really cares about performance is when doing git
//! operations. Compared to (e.g.) reading INI files or iterating through vecs, git
//! operations are extremely expensive. Where possible the results of git
//! operations are cached and reused, with the assumption that the repositories
//! won't be changed from the outside while mgit is running. (And if they are, the
//! effect is that some results may be out-of-date â€“ nothing critical.)
