//! Library that drives mgit.
//!
//! Note that this is (the third iteration of) my first real Rust project. In
//! other words: it's not the utter disaster that was the first version, but I
//! still don't know whether I'm using Rust "correctly." If the code looks
//! wonky, it's probably not because it's doing something clever; it's probably
//! because it's wonky. (Please let me know! Working out the wonkiness is an
//! important part of this exercise.)
//!
//! In terms of performance (namely, copying values around) mgit tries to be as
//! reasonable as possible. References are used wherever my not-quite-complete
//! understanding allows for it. But if there's a choice between clean, clear
//! code that copies values and some monstrosity that's nasty but avoids
//! copies, mgit chooses clean+copy. In practice, this usually means copying a
//! small-ish (say, < 100 items) collection of primitive values, so the actual
//! performance hit is negligible.
//!
//! The only place where mgit really cares about performance is when doing git
//! operations. Compared to (e.g.) reading INI files or iterating through vecs,
//! git operations are extremely expensive. Where possible the results of
//! git operations are cached and reused, with the assumption that the
//! repositories won't be changed from the outside while mgit is running. (And
//! if they are, the effect is that some results may be out-of-date â€“ nothing
//! critical.)
