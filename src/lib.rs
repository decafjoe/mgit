//! Library that drives mgit.
//!
//! Note that this is (the third iteration of) my first real Rust
//! project. In other words: it's not the utter disaster that was the
//! first version, but I still don't know whether I'm using Rust
//! "correctly." If the code looks wonky, it's probably not because
//! it's doing something clever; it's probably because it's wonky.
//! (Please let me know! Working out the wonkiness is an important
//! part of this exercise.)
//!
//! In terms of performance (namely, copying values around) mgit tries
//! to be as reasonable as possible. References are used wherever my
//! not-quite-complete understanding allows for it. But if there's a
//! choice between clean, clear code that copies values and some
//! monstrosity that's nasty but avoids copies, mgit chooses
//! clean+copy. In practice, this usually means copying a small-ish
//! (say, < 100 items) collection of primitive values, so the actual
//! performance hit is negligible.
//!
//! The only place where mgit really cares about performance is when
//! doing git operations. Compared to (e.g.) reading INI files or
//! iterating through vecs, git operations are extremely expensive.
//! Where possible the results of git operations are cached and
//! reused, with the assumption that the repositories won't be changed
//! from the outside while mgit is running. (And if they are, the
//! effect is that some results may be out-of-date â€“ nothing
//! critical.)
