///
/// If a remote is fetched successfully, mgit iterates through the
/// list of local branches that are tracking an upstream branch from
/// the remote. If the remote is a simple fast-forward from local,
/// mgit goes ahead and does so.
///
/// mgit will not touch the local branch if it contains commits that
/// are not known to the upstream (i.e. if local is ahead of upstream,
/// or if the branches have diverged).
///
/// If the local branch is HEAD, mgit will additionally check that the
/// worktree is completely clean (i.e. there is nothing in the index,
/// there are no modified files, there are no untracked files). If the
/// worktree is anything but pristine, mgit will not try to
/// fast-forward.
///
/// # Git Executable vs libgit2
///
/// For the fetch, the git executable is used instead of the libgit2
/// bindings (i.e. this creates a child process that runs `git fetch
/// <remote>` in the repo's directory).
///
/// A while back I wrote a Python version of mgit which also used the
/// libgit2 bindings and it did not play well with git-remote-gcrypt.
/// I'm sure it can be made to work, but the number of lines of code
/// it would take compared to the couple tens of lines it takes to use
/// a child process makes it a hard sell.
///
/// More generally, using the libgit2 API would seem to break *any*
/// git remote helper program that relies on the
/// `git-remote-XYZ`-as-a-command-on-PATH pattern.
///
/// Performance-wise, the fetch itself is going to be in a completely
/// different league of slow than any difference between subprocess
/// and in-process API usage. So... no loss there.
///
/// Technically, I guess the git executable might not be present (and
/// the code does not handle this case). But, seriously, who's using
/// mgit that doesn't have git installed and on the PATH? (Those sound
/// an awful lot like famous last words.)
